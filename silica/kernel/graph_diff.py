    Rules (S3.2):
      1. Reject if unplanned orphans increase.
         An orphan is unplanned if it is in post.orphans, was NOT in pre.orphans,
         and was NOT explicitly created by this payload (created_paths).
      2. Reject if unresolved links from PRE-EXISTING notes increase.
         A new unresolved link is only a regression when its *source* is a
         pre-existing note. Ghost links from *newly created* notes are
         intentional forward references to concepts not yet in the vault —
         they mirror the same exemption that Rule 1 already grants to newly
         created orphans (unplanned_orphans = new_orphans - norm_created).
