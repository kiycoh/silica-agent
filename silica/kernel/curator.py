"""Curator composer — project graph_report findings into a typed CurationPlan.

The vault already has every remediation *mechanism* (/dedup, /refine, orphan
repair, autolink) but they are all *pull*: a vault is only curated when the
user remembers to. This module is the *initiative* half — a pure projection
from the L1 VaultReport onto a plan of typed items the dispatch layer
(silica.tools.curate) then enqueues on the existing capability seam. No new
power: every item maps onto a WorkItem kind (or the mechanical autolink path)
that already exists.

Finding → item (spec-hermes-coherence §5):
    strong autolink candidate  → autolink  (mechanical, no LLM, direct commit)
    orphan                     → orphan    WorkItem
    high-similarity pair       → dedup     WorkItem (ternary verdict incl.
                                            contradicts → contested sweep)
    oversized / lean note      → refine    WorkItem

Pure & kernel-legal: reads only graph_report dataclasses, no I/O, no
router/capabilities import (import-linter boundary). It is the curator's twin
of kernel.analyst_plan — that one seeds the analyst ledger, this one drives the
background policy.
