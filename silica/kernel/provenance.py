"""Note<->source provenance ledger (spec-hermes-coherence §3).

Append-only record of which notes derive from which version (sha256) of an
ingested source file, keyed by source basename. Written at CLEANUP alongside
archiving (silica.router.states.finalize, sibling to _log_ingest_completion)
and read by graph_report (source drift section) and /ingest (re-ingest of a
modified source warning).

Storage: `<vault_path>/provenance.json` — a JSON array of records:
    {"source": "lecture-03.md", "sha256": "…", "run_id": "…",
     "date": "2026-07-02", "notes": ["Concepts/Note A", "Concepts/Note B"]}
`notes` entries are vault-relative note paths without the `.md` extension
(RunManifestEntry.path, which strips it) — NOT the same form as graph_report
node ids, which carry `.md` (driver index keys). Callers that intersect the
two (e.g. graph_report's source-drift section) must strip `.md` at the seam.

No hash lives in note frontmatter (user-facing noise) — provenance lives
only here, ledger-side.

Kernel-only: no router/capabilities imports (import-linter boundary).
Additive: a missing/unreadable/unwritable store degrades to "no records"
everywhere — nothing here ever raises out to its caller.
