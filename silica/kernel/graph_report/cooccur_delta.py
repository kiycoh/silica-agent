    Three PROPOSED, embedder-free signals (no network, pure local compute):

      - STALE     (wikilink − co-occurrence): wikilinked pairs whose notes share
        no concepts in text — a structural link without textual co-presence.
      - MISSING HUB (centrality − hub): a concept central in the discourse for
        which no note is titled — the next hub note to create.

    `cooccur_store` is injectable for testing; loaded from disk when None.
    Returns empty lists when the index is empty (best-effort, never raises).
