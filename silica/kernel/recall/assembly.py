"""Read-time assembly (IWE-informed): reconstitute atomic notes into assembled
context at recall time. Pure module — no I/O, no LLM. Callers inject edge and
body readers so the logic is unit-testable without a vault.

Three ported ideas (spec 2026-07-21): directional expansion (1.1), squash by
hub (1.3), breadcrumb (2.3). Ranking is NOT touched here: seeds arrive already
ranked/reranked; neighbours enter as periphery and are never re-ranked.
