"""Human-readable append-only journal at `<vault>/log.md`.

Every other run-state store under `.silica/` is machine-facing (Run
manifest, ledger, deferred store). This is the one artifact meant to be read
by a human — or by the agent at session start, via the vault-map tail —
without opening JSON.

One line per completed event, projected from data the caller already has:
this module contributes no new computation, only formatting + idempotent
append. The curator (future) and /organize are meant to log through the
same `append_log_line` helper so every write path narrates itself the same
way.

Kernel-only: no router/capabilities imports (import-linter boundary).
