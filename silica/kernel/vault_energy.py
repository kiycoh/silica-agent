"""E(vault): the lattice energy of the vault as a single scalar.

Formalises Part IV.1 of docs/Silica_x_chemistry.md. Every term already exists
as a field on VaultReport; this module only composes them. No new metric, no
new dependency, no LLM.

    E = -w1 * Σ cohesion(c)      # enthalpy: bonds formed, intra-cluster density
        + w2 * orphans          # entropic cost: unlinked matter
        + w3 * dangling         # broken bonds (links to non-existent notes)
        + w4 * Σ gap_density     # structural holes: absent-link fraction ∈ [0,1) per gap
        + w5 * Σ deficit.score  # concept-rich, weakly-linked notes (concepts/(1+degree))
        + w6 * contested        # unresolved polymorphs

Lower E = more coherent vault. The one negative term (cohesion) is the only
force that pulls E down; every other term is an entropic penalty.

E is a THERMOMETER, not an objective function (guardrail IV.5.1). Read it to
compare runs and to decide which gate lowered which term; never descend it with
a global optimiser. The vault is a dissipative steady state (Part III.3): it
improves per local event, not by chasing a global minimum.

Comparability caveat: cohesion and structural_gaps are only populated when the
report is built with full=True (compute_report skips them in the cheap nucleate
path). Compare E only across reports computed at the same depth.

History: extracted to evals/ by the 2026-07-21 ponytail audit (nothing in the
product consumed it); moved back 2026-07-24 (spec-harness-promotion §3) because
/status and the graph report now consume it. The frozen perturbation bench
(evals/test_vault_energy_bench.py) stays the behavioral pin.
