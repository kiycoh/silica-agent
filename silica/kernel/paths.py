"""Path canonicalization for vault notes and Silica runtime directories.

The CLI backend resolves notes by their vault-relative POSIX path. Any code
path that accepts a user- or agent-supplied note path MUST canonicalize it
through ``to_vault_relative`` before handing it to the driver — otherwise
absolute filesystem paths reach the Obsidian CLI verbatim and surface as a
misleading "No matches found" / "File not found", because the CLI indexes
by vault-relative path.

This module is the single source of truth for that normalization.
