"""Relatedness facade — fuses the two PROPOSE-layers into one note ranking.

Silica has two independent signals about which notes belong together:

  - **embeddings** (`kernel/embed.py`)        — holistic semantic similarity
  - **co-occurrence** (`kernel/cooccurrence.py`) — how the author actually
    co-mentions concepts (deterministic, embedder-free)

They live at different granularities (note-level vs concept-level) and on
incomparable scales (cosine in [0,1] vs unbounded integer weight). This module
is the single place where they meet. It:

  1. Reconciles granularity via a concept->notes **inverted index**, turning the
     concept-level co-occurrence graph into a note-level ranking.
  2. Fuses the two note rankings with **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** (RRF), which
     only consults rank position, so incomparable scores combine cleanly.
  3. Lets a degenerate proponent **abstain** (return None) instead of emitting a
     flat zero ranking that would poison RRF. A leg that abstains contributes no
     reciprocal-rank terms, so fusion degrades automatically to the survivor's
     ranking — "embedder down => routing on co-occurrence", with no special-case
     branch.

Provenance is preserved: every returned note carries an `evidence` list
(`embed:0.83`, `cooccur:w9`, or both).

Generalises the existing rule "embeddings PROPOSE, graph DISPOSES" into
"the proponents propose, the graph disposes": this facade is a proposer, never
authoritative about vault structure.
