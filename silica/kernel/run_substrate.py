"""Per-chunk semantic substrate builder — Block 4 / Phase 3+ of the plan.

embeddings PROPOSE — graph DISPOSES.

build_substrate() generates a compact '## Related Notes (candidates)' section
for the distiller context so the model can choose a `parent` from notes that
are semantically close to the current chunk but not yet directly linked in the
graph.  A 'graph-far' flag marks such candidates: high cosine but not a direct
link of any note already written in this run.

The function is best-effort: returns None on any error (embedder down, empty
index) so callers can safely skip the section.
