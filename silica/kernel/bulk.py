"""Vault write executor — the single authorised path for applying Ops.

Every write in Silica (FSM bulk write, deferred retry, interactive patch)
funnels through here. The per-op-type logic lives in small helpers; `execute_one`
is the shared single-op entry point and `execute_operations` is the batch loop
that aggregates results into a BulkResult.

Keeping one executor means any future change to how a write reaches disk
(e.g. atomic file writes at the DRIVER level) is inherited by every caller.

Post-write verify (falsifiable gate): every successful write/overwrite/patch/
delete dispatch is followed by a read-back through the DRIVER (_verify_landed /
_verify_deleted) that is compared against the body actually composed for the
DRIVER call — never raw op.content. `success: True` used to mean only "the
DRIVER call didn't raise"; a mismatch here raises VerifyMismatchError, which
the existing exception handling in execute_one/execute_operations already
turns into a failed op — no new failure machinery, just a stricter definition
of success.

VerifyMismatchError is a distinct type (not a plain ValueError) because it
carries a different fact than every other execute_one failure: the DRIVER
call already happened and something landed on disk (possibly corrupted).
Every other failure (missing params, a driver error raised before/without a
successful write) still means "nothing landed" — commit_note_atomic relies on
this distinction to decide whether a revert is needed.

    STOPGAP (deliberate, ceiling below): comparison strips edge whitespace
    before comparing. Root cause is `cli_backend._run_cli` doing
    `result.stdout.strip()`, which `read_note` returns verbatim — so on the
    cli backend a byte-for-byte compare would false-fail every healthy write
