"""Context assembler for single-checkpoint LLM calls (Phase 2).

Guarantees that each LLM invocation receives exactly:
  1. ledger_digest — compact (<500 token) run summary.
  2. checkpoint payload — the input slice for this specific step.
  3. substrate — optional pre-fetched candidates from embeddings/graph (Phase 3+).

Nothing outside these three sources is forwarded to the model.
The function is pure (no I/O, no side-effects) and is safe to call from tests
without any external dependencies.
