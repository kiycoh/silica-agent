"""Capability registry — THE dispatch seam for background work.

A *capability* is a self-contained background behaviour: a plain
``run(item, config) -> dict`` function that claims a WorkItem of one ``kind`` and
executes it under that behaviour's bounds. One ``kind`` is owned by exactly one
capability, so dispatch is a keyed lookup — the same shape as the ``TOOLS``
table — not a scan. Adding a behaviour is: drop one module here and add one
line to ``CAPABILITIES``.

Everything that runs in the background flows through this registry:

  * in-run WorkItems produced by the Injector/Coordinator (dedup, orphan),
  * ad-hoc batches from /dedup, /refine, /enrich (via ``run_subagent_batch``),
  * worker-profile tasks (reader, router, ...) — every WorkerProfile is
    registered here under its own name via ``run_worker_item`` below, so
    PROFILES is an implementation detail, not a second dispatch table.

This package is also the home of the worker engine itself (``profile``,
``profiles_builtin``, ``runtime``, ``prompts/``): the profiles and the seam
that dispatches them are two halves of one concept — procedural memory.
The execution engine is always ``BoundedSubAgent`` + the shared consumer loop
in ``silica/agent/subagent.py``; FSM pipelines (injector/refiner/organizer)
are deterministic foreground flows and intentionally stay outside this seam.
