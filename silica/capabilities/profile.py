"""Typed worker shapes.

A WorkerProfile is the typed shape of a worker: its permitted tool subset, its
iteration cap, its system prompt, and a parser that turns the worker's final
text + tool trace into a structured WorkerResult.
Built-in profiles live in profiles_builtin.py and are registered straight into
CAPABILITIES (silica/capabilities/__init__.py) — there is no second registry.
