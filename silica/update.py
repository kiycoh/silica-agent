"""`silica update` — pull the latest source, refusing to land code that
doesn't even byte-compile, and refresh deps only when they changed.

Silica installs as an editable git checkout (`uv pip install -e .`), so the
working tree *is* the running code: updating is a `git pull`, and there is no
reinstall for pure-Python changes. The one corruption risk — pulling code with
a syntax error, which would brick the CLI on next launch — is guarded by a
post-pull `compileall` that rolls back to the pre-pull commit on failure.
