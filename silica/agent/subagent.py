"""BoundedSubAgent — a small, tightly-bounded worker that runs on the worker model.

A bounded sub-agent consumes one WorkItem at a time and dispatches it to the
capability registered under ``item.kind``. Each capability (see
``silica/capabilities/``) is a self-contained ``run(item, config) -> dict``
function that writes only through its CapabilityBounds + the commit_ops micro-gate.
The sub-agent runs on the *worker* model (role="worker"), concurrently with the
Injector.

``BoundedSubAgent`` itself is just the dispatch seam: it owns the worker config,
catches capability errors so a single item never crashes the pool, and returns a
status dict. Adding a behaviour means adding a capability module + one registry
line — never editing this file.
