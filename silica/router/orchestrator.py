"""L3 Router / Orchestrator for Silica — Injector FSM (S2.3 complete).

From SILICA.md §3 L3 & §7.3:
  Deterministic state machine for the Injector pipeline.
  Gates: >= 10% rejection rate -> abort + rollback.

Contracts applied (see silica_architecture_addendum.md):
  C1 — ops_path carries list[Op]-compatible dicts after VALIDATE.
  C2 — freshness via per-op postconditions in CLI backend.
  C3 — build_txn() builds InverseOp entries; ROLLBACK applies them.
  C4 — VALIDATE overwrites ops_path; SNAPSHOT/WRITE read that same file.
  C5 — ledger records ops; CLEANUP only reachable from DONE state.

S2.3 change: DELEGATE calls the real Distiller LLM via prep_delegation.
S2.3 change: SNAPSHOT uses build_txn() directly (no _txn_obj leak).
S2.3 change: ledger.py integrated (CLEANUP writes 'committed', ROLLBACK marks 'rolled_back').
