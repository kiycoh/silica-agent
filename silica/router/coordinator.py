"""Coordinator — runs the Injector and a pool of bounded sub-agents concurrently.

Producer/consumer model:
  * the InjectorFSM (router model) runs on the calling thread and *produces*
    WorkItems as it commits batches — it never blocks on a sub-agent;
  * a ThreadPoolExecutor of BoundedSubAgents (worker model) *consumes* the queue
    in parallel, writing only through their CapabilityBounds + the commit_ops micro-gate;
  * after the Injector finishes, the Coordinator closes the queue and joins the
    pool (drains remaining items) before returning an aggregated status.

When no items are ever produced this collapses to single-FSM behaviour with
negligible overhead.
