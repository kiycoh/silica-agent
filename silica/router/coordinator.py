"""Coordinator — runs the Injector and a pool of leashed sub-agents concurrently.

Producer/consumer model:
  * the InjectorFSM (router model) runs on the calling thread and *produces*
    WorkItems as it commits batches — it never blocks on a sub-agent;
  * a ThreadPoolExecutor of LeashedSubAgents (worker model) *consumes* the queue
    in parallel, writing only through their Leash + the commit_ops micro-gate;
  * after the Injector finishes, the Coordinator closes the queue and joins the
    pool (drains remaining items) before returning an aggregated status.

When `subagents_enabled` is false (or no items are ever produced) this collapses
to the legacy single-FSM behaviour with negligible overhead.
