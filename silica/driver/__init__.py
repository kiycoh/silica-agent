"""Obsidian Driver package — exposes the global DRIVER instance.

The backend is selected at import time based on CONFIG.backend (from config.py),
which reads the SILICA_BACKEND environment variable:
  - "fs" (default): ObsidianFSBackend — direct filesystem access, headless, no Obsidian required
  - "cli": ObsidianCLIBackend — wraps the official Obsidian CLI (adds version-history
    rollback for patch ops, live metadata-cache reads, and user link-format preference
    in autolink; requires the Obsidian desktop app to be running)

Usage:
    from silica.driver import DRIVER
    content = DRIVER.read_note("Computer Vision")
