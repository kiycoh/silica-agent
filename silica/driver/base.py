"""Obsidian Driver — L0 abstraction over the vault I/O substrate.

From SILICA.md §3 L0:
  Adapter typed by DOMAIN, not by transport. Everything else talks to the
  Driver, never to disk or CLI directly. Two interchangeable backends:
  - cli: wraps the official Obsidian CLI (requires desktop app >= 1.12.7)
  - fs:  direct filesystem + index (derived from Hermes scripts)

This module defines the Protocol (interface), domain types, and the
global DRIVER instance selected at runtime.
