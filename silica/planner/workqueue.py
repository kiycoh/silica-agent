"""WorkQueue — the producer/consumer channel between the Injector and sub-agents.

The Injector (router) *produces* WorkItems as it commits batches; a pool of
leashed sub-agents *consumes* them concurrently on the worker model.  The router
never blocks on a sub-agent: it enqueues fire-and-forget and the Coordinator
drains/joins the queue only at the end of the run.

Concurrency safety has two layers:
  1. Temporal disjointness — items reference only notes from already-committed
     batches (or pre-existing vault notes), so the router is never mid-write on a
     sub-agent's target.
  2. Per-path lease — `path_lease()` serialises writes to the same note across
     sub-agents (and any lease-aware writer).  Both the Injector and the pool run
     as threads in one process, so an in-process lock registry is sufficient.

WorkItem kinds:
  "dedup"  — a borderline pair: append the candidate concept's unique info into an
             existing (larger) note.  context: {candidate, match_path, score, ...}
  "refine" — a freshly committed note flagged by lint: restyle without info loss.
  "orphan" — a note left orphaned by the graph gate: connect it.
