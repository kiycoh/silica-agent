## Why guardrails, not trust

You already let deterministic tools rewrite and reject your work every day. You don't extend them trust; you trust the guardrail. Silica wraps an LLM's edits to your vault in the same kind of guardrail:

| You already let a deterministic tool… | to guard against… | Silica does the same for a vault by… |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| a **compiler** reject source that won't build | syntax and type errors | an FSM refusing to commit a note that fails its structural checks |
| a **test suite** block a merge that breaks behavior | regressions | a post-write **verify gate** that reverts any edit which breaks vault coherence |
| **git** roll back a bad commit | losing history | `/undo` and `/revert` rolling back an injection, per-note or per-run |
| a **formatter** rewrite your code without asking | drift and inconsistency | graph-safe refactors that redirect links so a merge or split never orphans a note |

You don't have to believe anything about the model. You only have to believe that compilers and test suites exist, and that the same discipline can wrap a knowledge base.

## Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/pipeline.svg" alt="Silica vault pipeline mapped onto a software engineering pipeline" width="880" />
</p>

Silica is a CLI-based, FSM-orchestrated agent that manages Obsidian vaults, keeping context of how their pieces relate: co-occurrence, hyperlinks, graph. Codebases, images, and `.pdf`/`.docx`/`.txt` documents are in progress (see [Status](#status)).

- Silica is ***local-first*** (LM Studio, Ollama); OpenRouter is also supported.
- **Silica guards against vault corruption and structural clutter** through safety-hardened tools and layered rollback.
- Silica maintains a vault index **separate from your files**.
- Silica is **not** a free-form agent orchestrator: every write passes through a state machine.

---

## Git isn't enough

`git revert` restores a file's bytes. It cannot see that the edit orphaned a note, broke a wikilink, or created a near-duplicate of a concept you already had, because coherence lives in the *graph between* files, not in any single file's bytes. That's the failure git is blind to, and it's exactly the one Silica's verify gate and graph-safe refactors catch.

So run git *alongside* Silica, not instead of it: git is the byte-level backstop, Silica is the coherence layer on top. Belt and suspenders.

---

## Design contracts

Silica is not a free-form agent. Every vault mutation passes through a finite-state machine that enforces these contracts:

- **Single entry point** - all ingestion flows through the Injector FSM. There is no side channel that writes to the vault.
- **Verify-or-revert** - every write is re-read and checked afterward; a mismatch (`VerifyMismatchError`) rolls the write back.
- **Graph-safe moves** - renames, merges, and splits redirect incoming links atomically. No operation leaves a broken reference or an orphan.
- **Zero-trust ingress** - external content (e.g. web search) can only land in `Inbox/`. Nothing reaches the vault without explicit human staging and FSM review.
- **Layered rollback** - `/undo` (per note), `/revert` (per run), and optional `SILICA_GIT_COMMIT=auto` stack as independent safety nets.

The full schematic (interfaces, agent loop, ingress adapters, the Injector FSM state sequence, the kernel, write backends, and persistence):

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/architecture.svg" alt="Silica Architectural Schematic" width="880" />
</p>

> **Honesty note.** These are enforced *today* by the FSM on the normal write path. They are not yet *crash-verified*: a chaos harness that kills the process mid-write to prove the invariants survive failure is [in progress](#status). Trust the contracts for what they are: enforced control flow, not a formal proof under adversarial faults.

---

## What Silica is not

- **Not a "point AI at your notes" button.** Ingestion keeps a human in the loop: the agent proposes, the FSM gates, you confirm.
- **Not a correctness proof.** "Coherence" is a heuristic target enforced by contracts, not a theorem. Silica shrinks the blast radius of a bad edit; it does not guarantee the edit was *semantically* right.
- **Not a backup.** It runs alongside git and your own backups, never in place of them.
- **Not a free-form orchestrator.** No open-ended tool-calling loop over your vault - the state machine is the only way in.

---

## Use Cases

1. **Automated Inbox Ingestion** - Reads raw clippings and drafts from an inbox directory, distills them into atomic markdown concepts, resolves duplicate matches against the existing vault, and writes them safely.
2. **Conversational Vault Querying** - Query your notes, map paths across the graph, and generate outlines or synthesis documents using semantic search and graph-traversal tools in the REPL.
3. **Graph-Safe Note Refactoring** - Handles complex merges and splits of concept notes, redirecting incoming links automatically to prevent broken references or orphaned files.

## Quick Start

### Installation
Clone the repository and install it in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiycoh/silica-agent.git
cd silica-agent
uv pip install -e .
```

### Setup

Run the interactive wizard - it writes your `.env` (vault, backend, chat provider, embeddings) and finishes with a diagnostic report:

```bash
uv run silica init
```

Re-check the environment at any time:

```bash
uv run silica doctor
```

### Execution

Start the interactive REPL:

```bash
uv run silica
```

A good first move on an existing vault is a read-only structural audit. It never writes, and it shows you the hubs, bridges, and orphans before you touch anything:

```
/report
```

Then run the ingestion pipeline from inside the REPL:

```
/ingest Inbox/note.md --target=Concepts/AI
```

### MCP server (Silica as agent memory)

`silica mcp` serves the vault over stdio to any MCP client — semantic/text search, note reading, and gated single-note writing (12 tools; `--all` exposes the full toolset). For Claude Code the repo is also a plugin: one install wires the MCP server **and** the `silica` skill (the recall-before-answering / capture-after-learning loop):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/silica-agent   # or the GitHub repo
claude plugin install silica@silica
```

To wire only the MCP server, without the skill:

```bash
claude mcp add silica -- uv run --project /path/to/silica-agent --with mcp silica mcp
```

The vault resolves like the REPL: `SILICA_VAULT` if set (add `-e SILICA_VAULT=/path/to/vault` to pin one), else from the client's working directory — a project repo gets its `docs/silica`. Requires the `[mcp]` extra (`uv pip install -e '.[mcp]'`).

### REPL Commands

**Workflow** - agent-directed:

| Command | Usage | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/report` | `[folder] [--top-k=N] [--embeddings]` | Structural audit of the vault (hubs, bridges, orphans). Pauses for confirmation. |
| `/ingest` | `<file...> [--target=DIR] [--hub=H]` | Bring files in: notes via Injector FSM, code as skeleton stubs |
| `/organize` | `"<intent>" [--scope=FOLDER] [--file=taxonomy.yaml] [--merge] [--move-uncategorized] [--apply]` | Classify and reorganize vault notes according to a taxonomy |

**Direct** - immediate, no LLM round-trip:

| Command | Usage | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/status` | `[run_id]` | Progress digest of the last run |
| `/convert` | `<file...> [--target=DIR]` | Transcode a non-`.md` file (PDF) into a markdown note in the inbox |
| `/web-search` | `"<concept>" [--max-searches=N]` | Research a concept on the web → cited findings note in the Inbox (then `/ingest`) |
| `/embed` | `[folder] [--force]` | Build/update the embedding index |
| `/cooccur` | `[folder] [--force]` | Build/update the co-occurrence index (no embedder needed) |
| `/graph` | `[out.html] [folder]` | Export the knowledge graph |
| `/map` | `<nota> [--force]` | Radial mind-map rooted on a note → `maps/<stem>.canvas` |
| `/find` | `<query> [--k=N]` | Semantic search |
| `/undo` | `[note-path]` | Undo the last patch on a note |
| `/review` | `[--flush=HASH]` | Inspect the async review queue (deferred ops) |
| `/revert` | `[run-id]` | Revert a whole injection (per-run, LIFO) |
| `/dedup` | `[folder]` | Deduplicate notes (sub-agent) |
| `/curate` | `[folder] [--apply]` | Curate the vault: plan autolink/orphan/dedup/refine work (dry-run; `--apply` executes) |
| `/refine` | `[folder]` | Enrich and normalize notes (sub-agent) |
| `/enrich` | `[folder]` | Enrich note semantics (sub-agent) |
| `/stale [--all]` | | List notes whose `documents:` sources changed structurally since `code_ref` (`--all` includes cosmetic body-only changes) |
| `/plans` | | List `plans/` notes grouped by `status:` |

**System:** `/help` · `/model` · `/tools` · `/clear` · `/verbose` · `/thinking` · `/vault [path]` (show or switch the active vault for this session) · `/exit`

---

## Configuration

Configure the agent via environment variables (e.g., in a `.env` file). `silica init` writes the essentials for you; the full list with defaults lives in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `SILICA_MODEL` | Chat LLM model identifier (litellm format, e.g. `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) |
| `SILICA_PROVIDER` | Chat provider preset: `lmstudio` or `openrouter` |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Required when the provider is `openrouter` |
| `SILICA_VAULT` | Vault path. An Obsidian vault (`.obsidian/`) is used verbatim; any other path is repo mode → `docs/silica/` |
| `SILICA_BACKEND` | `fs` (headless filesystem, default) or `cli` (live Obsidian desktop via CDP; adds rollback + live cache) |
| `SILICA_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Embedding model identifier used for semantic tasks (default: `qwen3-embedding-4b`) |
| `SILICA_WORKER_MODEL` | Sub-agent worker model (e.g., a small local model for dedup / refinement) |
| `SILICA_GIT_COMMIT` | Git commit safety net for vault writes (`off`, `auto`) |
| `SILICA_TAVILY_API_KEY` | API key for Tavily search (enables the `/web-search` command) |

---

## Status

Silica is under active development. This is where it honestly stands:

- **Available now** - Obsidian vault ingestion (notes), structural audit (`/report`), semantic (`/find`) and embedder-free co-occurrence search, graph-safe refactor / dedup / merge, git safety net, layered `/undo` and `/revert`, the MCP server (`silica mcp`) with the Claude Code plugin packaging.
- **In progress** - codebase ingestion (skeleton stubs today), PDF/DOCX/TXT ingestion, the live Obsidian bridge (`silica connect`, feature-complete but pending end-to-end hardening), and the crash/chaos harness backing the [design contracts](#design-contracts).
- **Planned** - image ingestion and MCP/skill packaging for non-Claude coding agents.

Distinguish carefully: what ships today is enforced; what's listed above as in-progress or planned is not yet present.

## Quirks & Features

* **Token-Efficient Vault Auditing (`/report`)** - Computes community-detection clusters (Louvain modularity), god-nodes (high-degree hubs), structural bridges (inter-community connectors), and orphans, then builds a full structural remediation plan for a vault of **1,000+ markdown files in under 10 seconds**.
* **Parallel Worker Sub-Agents** - Cognitive-heavy batch operations like semantic deduplication (`/dedup`) and detail refinement (`/refine`, `/enrich`) are offloaded to leashed sub-agents. These run concurrently (up to `SILICA_SUBAGENT_MAX_CONCURRENT`) on a separate worker model (`SILICA_WORKER_MODEL`), keeping the main model's context window clean.
* **Embedder-Free Concept Modeling** - If an embedding model is offline or unconfigured, concept matching degrades gracefully to a deterministic, local co-occurrence graph (`/cooccur`) - querying relatedness and labeling communities in `/graph` exports with no network calls or LLM queries.
