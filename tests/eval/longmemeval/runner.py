"""LongMemEval adapter — chat-memory QA scored by an LLM judge.

Silica's home turf: long-term conversational memory. Unlike MuSiQue (one
shared corpus, recall@k), LongMemEval gives every question its OWN timestamped
haystack of chat sessions and scores QA correctness with an LLM judge across
six ability types (single-session-user/assistant/preference, temporal-reasoning,
knowledge-update, multi-session) plus abstention (``question_id`` ending _abs).

Per-question pipeline (retrieval-then-answer — the config comparable 1:1 with
Mem0 / Zep, not the agentic loop):

  1. load    — one .md note per session into a fresh isolated vault; the session
               date + id go in frontmatter (temporal-reasoning needs the date).
               Default is verbatim, so this bypasses the OFM lint (the code-wiki
               rationale: external ground truth, the structural validators do not
               apply — and chat text with literal '[[' must not be rejected).
               ``--distill`` instead routes each session through the Silica
               distiller (the mem0-comparable LLM ingest); it runs per-session so
               one note stays one session and session_recall holds, and falls
               back to verbatim if the distiller errors on a session.
  2. index   — cooccur (offline) and, when an embedder is served, embeddings.
  3. perceive— retrieval AND context assembly are silica.kernel.perception
               .perceive(), the product path: fused facade + rerank, per-note
               query-densest window under rank/evidence/date headers, episodic
               facts first. The harness owns no context assembler, so eval and
               product cannot diverge on this seam. (``--stuff`` skips
               retrieval and feeds every session, isolating the reasoning
               ceiling — the right mode for the oracle split.)
  4. answer  — the configured chat model answers from ONLY the retrieved memory;
               told to decline when the memory lacks the answer (abstention).
  5. judge   — the judge model applies the LongMemEval rubric (per-type prompt);
               'yes' in the reply => correct. Prompts mirror
               github.com/xiaowu0162/LongMemEval src/evaluation/evaluate_qa.py.

  uv run python -m tests.eval.longmemeval \
      --data longmemeval_oracle.json --run-root bench/lme --stuff --limit 20

Requires an LLM for answer + judge (litellm, via CONFIG.model). The embedder is
optional (cooccur leg / --stuff work offline). The personal-memory lane
(ADR-0019) is never passed — only the question's own sessions can be recalled.
