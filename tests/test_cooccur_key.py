"""CooccurStore keyspace is `.md`-suffix agnostic (single-source-of-truth key).

The landmine this pins: producers store the stripped path ('notes/foo') while
consumers pass graph node ids that carry '.md' ('notes/foo.md'). Without one
canonical key the lookup misses silently — community_labels drops the community
and falls back to 'Cluster N'. The store must own the normalization so no caller
can diverge.
