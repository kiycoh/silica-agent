"""Architectural boundary for the relatedness facade.

kernel/relatedness.py is the single place where the two PROPOSE-legs
(embeddings, co-occurrence) are fused into a note ranking. Relatedness
*queries* must go through it; direct imports of the legs are reserved for:

  - index maintenance (build/refresh/delete entries),
  - pairwise cosine math that does not fit rank fusion (dedup windows,
    salience gates, missing-link thresholds),
  - constructing stores to inject INTO the facade.

This test pins the set of modules allowed to import the legs directly. A new
direct-import site fails here and forces an explicit decision: route through
the facade, or extend the allowlist with a justification.
