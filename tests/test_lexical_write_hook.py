"""Pins the LexicalStore save/load roundtrip the write choke-point hook
relies on: a committed note becomes queryable after an upsert+save+load
cycle. The hook's index-presence gating and wiring are verified by
inspection of silica/router/states/write.py and orchestrator.py's
_flush_indexes (no lexical.json on disk => the hook never touches the
store, so non-lexical vaults stay byte-identical)."""
