"""Architectural invariants for the capability seam.

CAPABILITIES (silica/capabilities/__init__.py) is THE dispatch table for
background work: every WorkItem kind produced anywhere in silica/ must have a
registered capability, and every WorkerProfile must be dispatchable through
the same table (kind == profile name). A new producer or profile that bypasses
the seam fails here and forces an explicit decision.
