"""Tests for the silica_lexical_refresh bulk-seed tool.

Closes the bootstrap gap: the write-choke-point hook (write.py) only
maintains an existing lexical.json — nothing previously created one. This
tool is the lexical twin of silica_cooccurrence_refresh: seeds the whole-vault
BM25/fuzzy index from note text, with no LM Studio / no network.
