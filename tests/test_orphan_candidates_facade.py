"""Migration test: Coordinator._orphan_candidates routes through the relatedness
facade, fusing embeddings + co-occurrence instead of embeddings alone.

This is a pure candidate-generation site (no cosine thresholding), so swapping
cosine_top_k for the RRF facade is a clean, zero-regression upgrade: it gains
the co-occurrence leg and keeps working when the embedder index is empty.
